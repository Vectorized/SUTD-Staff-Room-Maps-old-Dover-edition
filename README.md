<h1>SUTD Staff Room Maps <br>(old Dover campus)</h1>

In the early days of Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), the first ISTD batch had a little project for their 50.001 Introduction to Information Systems and Programming course.

Now that we have moved to the new East Coast Campus, we shall put up the code used app for posterity purposes. Hopefully it will be beneficial to any future students getting learning Android app making or anyone looking for snippets of code.
